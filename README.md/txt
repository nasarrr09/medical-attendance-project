📌 Medical Exemption Verification System – A Solution Inspired by Experience
✨ About the Project
Earlier this year, I met with an accident and fractured my femur bone, which unfortunately left me unable to appear for my final exams.

During this time, I realized that most colleges don’t have a proper system in place to handle genuine medical cases. This is a serious concern—anyone can face unexpected medical issues, and yet there’s often no streamlined way to apply for and verify medical exemptions.

This experience sparked the idea for this project.

💡 The Motivation
“There are millions of ideas out there, but ideas mean nothing unless you work on them.”

This project represents the beginning of a bigger vision—to create a platform where students can submit their medical details, and the system can verify documents automatically, making the process smoother and more transparent for all.

It's not complete yet, but it's a working model of what this idea can grow into. I'm proud to share what I’ve built so far.

🛠 Current Features
✅ Collects student details like name, SAP ID, reason for leave, and prescription
✅ Extracts the doctor's email from the uploaded prescription
✅ Sends an automated verification mail to the doctor

there is alot coming in future for this project its just a beginning just stay updated!


🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

🙌 A Personal Note
This isn't just code—it's a story, a problem, and a solution all coming together.

I built this to help students like me, who face real problems during medical emergencies but have no official support mechanism.

I’m sharing this publicly, not because it’s complete—but because I believe in sharing progress, not perfection.
