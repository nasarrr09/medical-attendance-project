üìå Medical Exemption Verification System ‚Äì A Solution Inspired by Experience
‚ú® About the Project
Earlier this year, I met with an accident and fractured my femur bone, which unfortunately left me unable to appear for my final exams.

During this time, I realized that most colleges don‚Äôt have a proper system in place to handle genuine medical cases. This is a serious concern‚Äîanyone can face unexpected medical issues, and yet there‚Äôs often no streamlined way to apply for and verify medical exemptions.

This experience sparked the idea for this project.

üí° The Motivation
‚ÄúThere are millions of ideas out there, but ideas mean nothing unless you work on them.‚Äù

This project represents the beginning of a bigger vision‚Äîto create a platform where students can submit their medical details, and the system can verify documents automatically, making the process smoother and more transparent for all.

It's not complete yet, but it's a working model of what this idea can grow into. I'm proud to share what I‚Äôve built so far.

üõ† Current Features
‚úÖ Collects student details like name, SAP ID, reason for leave, and prescription
‚úÖ Extracts the doctor's email from the uploaded prescription
‚úÖ Sends an automated verification mail to the doctor

there is alot coming in future for this project its just a beginning just stay updated!


üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask)

Document Parsing: PyMuPDF / OCR

Email System: SMTP

Doctor Verification: Indian Medical Register API (in progress)

Frontend: (Coming soon)

üôå A Personal Note
This isn't just code‚Äîit's a story, a problem, and a solution all coming together.

I built this to help students like me, who face real problems during medical emergencies but have no official support mechanism.

I‚Äôm sharing this publicly, not because it‚Äôs complete‚Äîbut because I believe in sharing progress, not perfection.
